    "An alternative to Word2Vec is called [CBOW](http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3781) (Continuous Bag of Words). In the CBOW model, instead of predicting a context word from a word vector, you predict a word from the sum of all the word vectors in its context. Implement and evaluate a CBOW model trained on the text8 dataset.\n",
